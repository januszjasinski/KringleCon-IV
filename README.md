# KringleCon-IV

Including some extra stuff I thought may be worth your time looking at but most important of all is [my actual report](https://github.com/januszjasinski/KringleCon-IV/blob/main/report.pdf).

The report itself is 50 pages and obviously everything else below would take it to several hundred hence why the report is, well, the report I'm submitting :-)

Anyway, here's an awesome picture.

## Story

> Listen children to a story that was written in the cold
> 
> 'Bout a Kringle and his castle hosting hackers, meek and bold
> 
> Then from somewhere came another, built his tower tall and proud
> 
> Surely he, our Frosty villain hides intentions 'neath a shroud
> 
> So begins Jack's reckless mission: gather trolls to win a war
> 
> Build a con that's fresh and shiny, has this yet been done before?
> 
> Is his Fest more feint than folly? Some have noticed subtle clues
> 
> Running 'round and raiding repos, stealing Santa's Don'ts and Do's
> 
> Misdirected, scheming, grasping, Frost intends to seize the day
> 
> Funding research with a gift shop, can Frost build the better sleigh?
> 
> Lo, we find unlikely allies: trolls within Jack's own command
> 
> Doubting Frost and searching motive, questioning his dark demand
> 
> Is our Jack just lost and rotten - one more outlaw stomping toes?
> 
> Why then must we piece together cludgy, wacky radios?
> 
> With this object from the heavens, Frost must know his cover's blown
> 
> Hearkening from distant planet! We the heroes should have known
> 
> Go ahead and hack your neighbor, go ahead and phish a friend
> 
> Do it in the name of holidays, you can justify it at year's end
> 
> There won't be any retweets praising you, come disclosure day
> 
> But on the snowy evening after? Still Kris Kringle rides the sleigh
