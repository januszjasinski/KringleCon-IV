# Shellcode Primer

As mentioned in the report you could just go through to https://tracer.kringlecastle.com/?cheat and cheat but if you're too lazy to do even that then here we are!

## Introduction

> Welcome to Shellcode Primer!
> 
> The goal of Shellcode Primer is to teach you how to write some basic x64 shellcode for reading a file. We'll take you through each piece of what you need, step by step, and show you what's going on.
> 
> First, let's learn the user interface a bit. There's some code below. The left is where you type code, and the right will attempt to syntax-highlight and show build errors.
> 
> For the time being, you don't need to change anything, just have a look at what it's doing - it's more or less the same type of stuff you're going to be learning.
> 
> Go ahead and execute the code (using the bottom below) and play around in the debugger. On the left, you'll see instructions executing in the order that they execute. Click on them to the state when that instruction executes!
> 
> Also, don't forget to click that hint button below! Hints don't cost you anything. :)

```shellcode
; Set up some registers (sorta like variables) with values
; In the debugger, look how these change!
mov rax, 0
mov rbx, 1
mov rcx, 2
mov rdx, 3
mov rsi, 4
mov rdi, 5
mov rbp, 6

; Push and pop - watch how the stack changes!
push 0x12345678
pop rax

push 0x1111
push 0x2222
push 0x3333
pop rax
pop rax
pop rax

; This creates a string and references it in rax - watch the debugger!
call getstring
  db "Hello World!",0
getstring:
pop rax

; Finally, return 0x1337
mov rax, 0x1337
ret
```

## Loops

> Although you won't have to worry about writing a loop for any of these lessons, showing how a loop works is a good demo for the debugger.
> 
> Look at the code below, then execute it (no need to change it). Watch how the same code repeats, over and over, with rax changing in each loop.
> 
> Notice how the code listing below isn't the same as what is executed in the debugger. In the History section of the debugger, the instructions will change to show what is executed to achieve what you describe in the assembly source code.

```
; We want to loop 5 times - you can change this if you want!
mov rax, 5

; Top of the loop
top:
  ; Decrement rax
  dec rax

  ; Jump back to the top until rax is zero
  jnz top

; Cleanly return after the loop
ret
```

## Getting started

> Welcome! Are you ready to learn how to write shellcode? We hope so! First, some tips:
> 
> - Comments are denoted with a semicolon (;)
> - Don't forget to look at the debugger, line by line, if something is wrong
> - Really, don't forget to read the error list! We check each place where you might go wrong in your code
> - Your code for each level is saved in your browser, so you can leave and come back, refresh the page, and hop back to previous levels to borrow code
>
> This level currently fails to build because it has no code. Can you add a ```ret```urn statement at the end? Don't worry about what it's actually returning (yet!)
> 
> Feel free to check previous levels!

```
; This is a comment! We'll use comments to help guide your journey.
; Right now, we just need to RETurn!
;
; Enter a return statement below and hit Execute to see what happens!
ret
```

## Returning a value

> Now that we have an empty function, we can start building some code! Let's learn what a register is.
> 
> A register is like a variable, except there are a small number of them - you have about eight general purpose 64-bit integers registers on amd64 (we won't talk about floating point or other special registers):
> 
> - ```rax```
> - ```rbx```
> - ```rcx```
> - ```rdx```
> - ```rdi```
> - ```rsi```
> - ```rbp```
> - ```rsp```
> 
> All mathy stuff that a computer does (add, subtract, xor, etc) operates on registers, not directly on memory. So they're super important!
> 
> Specific registers have some implicit meaning, mostly by convention. For example, when a function returns, its return value is typically put in ```rax```. Let's do that!
> 
> To move a value into a register, use the ```mov``` instruction; for example:
> 
> ```mov rdx, 1```
> 
> In a higher-level language this would be equivalent to:
> 
> ```rdx = 1 â€”```
> 
> For this level, can you return the number '1337' from your function?
> 
> That means that rax must equal 1337 when the function returns.

```
; TODO: Set rax to 1337
mov rax, 1337

; Return, just like we did last time
ret
```

## System calls

> If you've made it this far, I bet you're wondering how to make your shellcode do something!
> 
> If you're familiar with Python, you might know how to use the ```open()``` function. If you know C, you might know the ```fopen()``` function. But what these and similar functions have in common is one thing: they're library code. And because shellcode needs to be self contained, we don't have (easy) access to library code!
> 
> So how do we deal with that?
> 
> Linux has something called a ```syscall```, or system call. A syscall is a request that a program makes that asks Linux - the kernel - to do something. And it turns out, at the end of the day, all of those library calls ultimately end with a syscall. [Here is a list of available syscalls on x64](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/) ([alternative](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md))
> 
> To perform a syscall:
> 
> - The number for the desired syscall is moved into ```rax```
> - The first parameter is moved into ```rdi```, the second into ```rsi```, and the third into ```rdx``` (there are others, but not many syscalls need more than 3 parameters)
> - Execute the ```syscall``` instruction
> 
> The second ```syscall``` executes, Linux flips into kernel mode and we can no longer debug it. When it's finished, it returns the result in ```rax```.
> 
> For this challenge, we're going to call ```sys_exit``` to exit the process with exit code 99.
> 
> Can you prepare ```rax``` and ```rdi``` with the correct values to exit?
> 
> As always, feel free to mess around as much as you like!

```
; TODO: Find the syscall number for sys_exit and put it in rax
mov rax, 60

; TODO: Put the exit_code we want (99) in rdi
mov rdi, 99

; Perform the actual syscall
syscall
```
