# Ingreta Tude

> Hey there! I’m Ingreta Tude. I really don’t like the direction Jack Frost is leading us.
> 
> He seems obsessed with beating Santa and taking over the holiday season. It just doesn’t seem right.
> 
> Why can’t we work together with Santa and the elves instead of trying to beat them?
> 
> But, I do have an Objective for you. We’re getting ready to launch a new website for Frost Tower, and the big guy has charged me with making sure it’s secure.
> 
> My sister, Ruby Cyster, created this site, and I don’t trust the results.
> 
> Can you please take a look at it to find flaws?
>

> Hey, I'm Icky McGoop.
> 
> Late? What's it to you? I got here when I got here.
> 
> So anyways, I thought you might be interested in this Yule Log4Jack. It's all the rage lately.
> 
> Yule Log4Jack is in a ton of software - helps our big guy keep track of things.
> 
> It's kind of like salt. It's in WAY more things than you normally think about.
> 
> In fact, a vulnerable Solr instance is running in an internal North Pole system, accessible in this terminal.

> Anyways, why don't you see if you can get to the ```yule.log``` file in this system?
