> 
> So this year, I've decided to beat Santa at his own game – I’m gonna take over the Holiday Season from the old man and dominate it myself.
> 
> I've built Frost Tower, the epicenter of Frostiness at the North Pole. Believe me, it's the BIGGEST North Pole tower the world has EVER seen! So much better than that lame castle next door.
> 
> And, quite frankly, our FrostFest conference is going to be the GREATEST con in the history of cons.
> 
> As for FrostFest, we honor all badges for entry, including those from the lame conference next door.
> 
> Oh, and make sure you visit the gift shop and buy some SWAG on your way out.

> 
> If you can help me solve the issue in this terminal, I’ll understand YARA so much better! Would you please check it out so I can learn?
> 
> And, I’ll tell you what – if you help me with YARA, I’ll give you some tips for Splunk!

> 
> I'm just hanging out here by the Logic Munchers game.
> 
> You know… logic: that thing that seems to be in short supply at the tower on the other side of the North Pole?
> 
> Oh, I'm sorry. That wasn't terribly kind, but those frosty souls do confuse me...
> 
> Anyway, I’m working my way through this Logic Munchers game.
> 
> A lot of it comes down to understanding boolean logic, like ```True And False``` is ```False```, but ```True And True``` is ```True```.
> 
> It can get a tad complex in the later levels.
> 
> I need some help, though. If you can show me how to complete a stage in Potpourri at the Intermediate (Stage 3) or higher, I’ll give you some hints for how to find vulnerabilities.
> 
> Specifically, I’ll give you some tips in finding flaws in some of the web applications I’ve heard about here at the North Pole, especially those associated with slot machines!

> 
> Are you new to programming? It's a handy skill for anyone in cyber security.
> 
> This here machine lets you control an Elf using Python 3. It’s pretty fun, but I’m having trouble getting beyond Level 8.
> 
> Tell you what… if you help me get past Level 8, I’ll share some of my SQLi tips with you. You may find them handy sometime around the North Pole this season.
> 
> Most of the information you'll need is provided during the game, but I'll give you a few more pointers, if you want them.
> 
> Not sure what a lever requires? Click it in the ```Current Level Objectives``` panel.
> 
> You can move the elf with commands like ````elf.moveLeft(5)```, ```elf.moveTo({"x":2,"y":2})```, or ```elf.moveTo(lever0.position)```.
> 
> Looping through long movements? Don't be afraid to ```moveUp(99)``` or whatever. You elf will stop at any obstacle.
> 
> You can call functions like ```myFunction()```. If you ever need to pass a function to a munchkin, you can use ```myFunction``` without the ```()```.

## After completion

> Gosh, with skills like that, I'll bet you could help figure out what's really going on next door...
> 
> And, as I promised, let me tell you what I know about SQL injection.
> 
> I hear that having source code for vulnerability discovery dramatically changes the vulnerability discovery process.
> 
> I imagine it changes how you approach an assessment too.
> 
> When you have the source code, API documentation becomes [tremendously](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) [valuable](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql).
> 
> Who knows? Maybe you'll even find more than one vulnerability in the code.
