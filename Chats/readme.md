> Hey there! I’m Ingreta Tude. I really don’t like the direction Jack Frost is leading us.
> 
> He seems obsessed with beating Santa and taking over the holiday season. It just doesn’t seem right.
> 
> Why can’t we work together with Santa and the elves instead of trying to beat them?
> 
> But, I do have an Objective for you. We’re getting ready to launch a new website for Frost Tower, and the big guy has charged me with making sure it’s secure.
> 
> My sister, Ruby Cyster, created this site, and I don’t trust the results.
> 
> Can you please take a look at it to find flaws?
> 
> Here is the [source code](https://download.holidayhackchallenge.com/2021/frosttower-web.zip) if you need it.

> Yo, I'm Grimy McTrollkins.
> 
> I'm a troll and I work for the big guy over there: Jack Frost.
> 
> I’d rather not be bothered talking with you, but I’m kind of in a bind and need your help.
> 
> Jack Frost is so obsessed with icy cold that he accidentally froze shut the door to Frost Tower!
> 
> I wonder if you can help me get back in.
> 
> I think we can melt the door open if we can just get access to the thermostat inside the building.
> 
> That thermostat uses Wi-Fi. And I’ll bet you picked up a Wi-Fi adapter for your badge when you got to the North Pole.
> 
> Click on your badge and go to the ```Items``` tab. There, you should see your Wi-Fi Dongle and a button to “Open Wi-Fi CLI.” That’ll give you command-line interface access to your badge’s wireless capabilities.

> Great - now I can get back in!

> Hey there, Gumshoe. Tangle Coalbox here again.
> 
> I've got a real doozy of a case for you this year.
> 
> Turns out some elves have gone on some misdirected journeys around the globe. It seems that someone is messing with their travel plans.
> 
> We could sure use your open source intelligence (OSINT) skills to find them.
> 
> Why dontcha' log into this vintage Cranberry Pi terminal and see if you have what it takes to track them around the globe.
> 
> If you're having any trouble with it, you might ask Piney Sappington right over there for tips.
