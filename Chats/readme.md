> Hey there! I’m Ingreta Tude. I really don’t like the direction Jack Frost is leading us.
> 
> He seems obsessed with beating Santa and taking over the holiday season. It just doesn’t seem right.
> 
> Why can’t we work together with Santa and the elves instead of trying to beat them?
> 
> But, I do have an Objective for you. We’re getting ready to launch a new website for Frost Tower, and the big guy has charged me with making sure it’s secure.
> 
> My sister, Ruby Cyster, created this site, and I don’t trust the results.
> 
> Can you please take a look at it to find flaws?
> 
> Here is the [source code](https://download.holidayhackchallenge.com/2021/frosttower-web.zip) if you need it.

> Yo, I'm Grimy McTrollkins.
> 
> I'm a troll and I work for the big guy over there: Jack Frost.
> 
> I’d rather not be bothered talking with you, but I’m kind of in a bind and need your help.
> 
> Jack Frost is so obsessed with icy cold that he accidentally froze shut the door to Frost Tower!
> 
> I wonder if you can help me get back in.
> 
> I think we can melt the door open if we can just get access to the thermostat inside the building.
> 
> That thermostat uses Wi-Fi. And I’ll bet you picked up a Wi-Fi adapter for your badge when you got to the North Pole.
> 
> Click on your badge and go to the ```Items``` tab. There, you should see your Wi-Fi Dongle and a button to “Open Wi-Fi CLI.” That’ll give you command-line interface access to your badge’s wireless capabilities.

> Great - now I can get back in!

> Hey, I'm Icky McGoop.
> 
> Late? What's it to you? I got here when I got here.
> 
> So anyways, I thought you might be interested in this Yule Log4Jack. It's all the rage lately.
> 
> Yule Log4Jack is in a ton of software - helps our big guy keep track of things.
> 
> It's kind of like salt. It's in WAY more things than you normally think about.
> 
> In fact, a vulnerable Solr instance is running in an internal North Pole system, accessible in this terminal.
> 
> Anyways, why don't you see if you can get to the ```yule.log``` file in this system?
